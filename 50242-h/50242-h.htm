<h3 class="generic">Editor&rsquo;s Note</h3>
<p>The late Pitts Sanborn wrote this booklet under the title
<i>Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies</i> and stated in a short
preface that it made &ldquo;no claim to originality and no secret of
its indebtedness to the masterly treatises on the same subject.&rdquo;
I have left Mr. Sanborn&rsquo;s pages on the symphonies virtually
intact and have only expanded the work a little by
incorporating here and there matter about other major works
of Beethoven&rsquo;s, especially some of the concertos, overtures,
piano and vocal works, besides certain of the greater specimens
of his chamber music. Even if this procedure probably
lends the booklet a patchy character, I have followed it in
order to supply a rather fuller picture of the composer&rsquo;s creative
achievements. No more than my predecessor do I make
the slightest claim to originality of matter or treatment, or
deny my indebtedness to Thayer and Paul Bekker.</p>

<h1 title=""><i>Ludwig van Beethoven</i></h1>
<p>Ludwig van Beethoven was born on December 16, 1770,
at Bonn, then one of the most important cities on the lower
Rhine. Though Bonn was German and Beethoven&rsquo;s mother
and his father&rsquo;s mother were both Germans, he was of Flemish
descent through his father&rsquo;s father, a native of the country
that eventually became Belgium, whence the &ldquo;van&rdquo; in the
name. Louis van Beethoven, a tenor singer, went to Bonn in
his youth and promptly became a court musician to the resident
archbishop-elector. His son Johann, Beethoven&rsquo;s father,
was also a singer in the Elector&rsquo;s employ, but he was a worthless
fellow, who was fortunate, however, in having as wife a
woman of character. Realizing that his son Ludwig had been
born with uncommon musical talent, he had the child begin
to study violin and piano very early with the idea of putting
him forward as a prodigy, as Mozart&rsquo;s father had done. But
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the young Ludwig was less precocious than Mozart and rebelled
strenuously against the enforced training. However,
he did appear at a concert on March 26, 1778.</p>
<p>So strong was the boy&rsquo;s musical gift that it triumphed over
every obstacle, including his own childish reluctance, and the
Elector thought it worth while to send him to Vienna, then
the musical capital of Europe. He had now been composing
for several years, and Haydn accepted him as a pupil in counterpoint,
an arrangement that did not turn out altogether to
Beethoven&rsquo;s satisfaction. He studied with other teachers in
Vienna and in March 1795, made his first public appearance
in that city, playing his own piano concerto in B flat major.
This date marks the beginning of a kind of recognition that
could only spur the young composer on to the activity that in
a nature so vigorous and energetic meant enthusiastic creation.
Of course he wanted to write a symphony. Mozart, dead
in 1791, had left a legacy of forty-nine symphonies. Haydn,
the author of many more, was in full career at 63. They were
the world&rsquo;s foremost symphonists.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony No. 1, in C Major, Op. 21</h3>
<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s First Symphony was brought out at a concert
which he gave in Vienna on April 2, 1800. It was immediately
successful and within a few months carried its composer&rsquo;s
fame all over Germany. In the musical city of Leipzig it was
described as &ldquo;intellectual, powerful, original, and difficult.&rdquo;
That was in 1802. Today it is no longer difficult for our accomplished
orchestras, but, as in the case of other works that have
come to seem simple through the passage of time and changes
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
in fashions, it is no easy matter now for a conductor to catch
and express the frank joyousness of its youthful speech.</p>
<p>The symphony is in the customary four sections or movements.
The key is C major. Yet it does not begin in that key,
but with a discord in F major which shocked some pedants at
the time. The slow introduction of twelve measures leads to
the first movement proper (&ldquo;Allegro con brio&rdquo;). Its pages
have spirit, gaiety, elegance, for this symphony has well been
termed a symphony of comedy, though here and there a
cloud may for the moment obscure its sunny brightness. The
eighteenth century was not over when Beethoven composed
it, and he was still looking at music through the eyes of Haydn
and Mozart, in spite of the fact that the student may readily
discover Beethovenish characteristics that are not derived
from either Haydn or Mozart and distinct intimations of the
moods and manners of the nineteenth century to come. However,
comedy itself is not all compact of sunshine and, as the
German proverb has it, laughter and weeping dwell in the
same bag.</p>
<p>This brisk Allegro is followed in the then-prevailing order
by the slow movement (&ldquo;Andante cantabile con moto,&rdquo; in
F major and consequently not too slow). It is mainly built up
on a tricksy tune that no less an authority than Professor Tovey
described as &ldquo;kittenish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig2">
<a href="music/img003a.mid"><img src="images/img003a.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="101" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img003a.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The attentive listener should observe in this movement
the recurrent passage of dotted notes for drums on G and then
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
on C, the drums being tuned not in the tonic, but in the dominant.
Yet bold though this device might have seemed, it was
not wholly original. Mozart had anticipated Beethoven in his
&ldquo;Linz&rdquo; Symphony.</p>
<p>The third movement in name is the minuet usual in symphonies
of the eighteenth century (&ldquo;Menuetto: Allegro molto
e vivace,&rdquo; in C major), but in reality Beethoven was already
looking forward to the scherzo (Italian, joke) with which he
was presently to replace the minuet. This movement, then, is
much less the stately dance in triple rhythm than a scherzo of
generous proportions, rich in modulations and glowing color.
The scherzo, like the minuet, always includes a trio section.
Listen in this trio to the delicious dialogue between wind instruments
and strings and to the rousing crescendo that ends
it just before the repetition of the minuet.</p>
<p>The Finale, in C major, opens with seven measures of
Adagio devoted to the gradual release of a scale passage. So
much accomplished, the music plunges into an &ldquo;Allegro molto
e vivace,&rdquo; beginning with this sprightly theme which races
along to the conclusion in a whirl of merriment and humorous
sallies.</p>

<h3 class="generic">First Three Piano Concertos</h3>
<p>Beethoven had settled permanently in Vienna in the autumn
of 1792 and the body of his work originated, of course,
in the Austrian capital. We cannot, however, dismiss the compositions
preceding the First Symphony as wholly negligible.
The creations of this period are to a large extent relatively
small in scale. There is a quantity of piano music largely in
the form of variations, a number of songs and several arias,
odds and ends of chamber music, dances, marches, and such.
Some of the variations for piano and strings are based on
melodies of Handel, Mozart, and a number of lesser lights.
During his Bonn days Beethoven had composed a score for
a &ldquo;knightly ballet&rdquo; (<i>Ritterballet</i>), performed by members
of the Bonn aristocracy and ascribed at first to Count Waldstein.
It was Beethoven&rsquo;s first ballet score and preceded by
some years his far more pretentious <i>Creatures of Prometheus</i>,
written in Vienna to a scenario by the noted dancer, Salvatore
Vigano.</p>
<p>The vocal compositions of this early period are not, perhaps,
of conspicuous quality. Beethoven&rsquo;s best-known song
and, indeed, his most famous (though not the best) is the
setting of Matthisson&rsquo;s <i>Adelaide</i>&mdash;more a <i>cantate</i> than what
we have come to classify as a genuine <i>Lied</i>. Considerably
later he was to write the cycle <i>An die ferne Geliebte</i>, which
together with some of his settings of Goethe poems and the
stark but majestic <i>Die Ehre Gottes aus der Natur</i>, may pass
as Beethoven&rsquo;s most memorable achievements in the province
of the solo song. To his Bonn days, however, belongs a genuine
cantata, the one composed in 1790 on the death of the
Emperor Joseph II. This work survives chiefly because one
of its finest pages was later utilized in the last scene of <i>Fidelio</i>,
into which it fits admirably.</p>
<p>Three years before the First Symphony Beethoven began
the first orchestral score he decided to publish. This was the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
B-flat Piano Concerto, which though we know it as No. 2,
opus 19, actually preceded the one in C major, opus 15. It
was performed for the first time by the composer March 29,
1795, on the occasion of his first appearance &ldquo;as virtuoso and
composer&rdquo; before the Viennese public. It had been announced
that he would play &ldquo;an entirely new concerto&rdquo; on
this occasion of the first two annual concerts given for the
benefit of the widows of the Tonk&uuml;nstler Society. Thayer, following
the lead of Nottebohm, felt certain that this &ldquo;new&rdquo;
concerto was the one in B flat. Beethoven was tardy in completing
it, and we are told that two days before the concert
the Rondo was not yet on paper. In spite of illness he wrote it
out at the eleventh hour, while four copyists sat in the next
room and were handed the piece, sheet by sheet, as soon as
the music was set down.</p>
<p>We know as good as nothing of the public reaction to
the work. We do know, however, that the composer was far
from satisfied with it and revised the score before playing it
in Prague in 1798. At that, he confided to the publisher, Franz
Hoffmeister, that he &ldquo;did not consider it one of his best.&rdquo; The
first movement has a vigorous and arresting first theme, followed
by a tranquil, songful one. Some of the cantabile
phrases that follow have a rather Mozartean character. The
Adagio begins with a devout, rather hymnlike melody, on
which the piano subsequently embroiders. The Finale, a
rondo with a playful recurrent theme suggestive of Haydn,
contains a second lilting melody and another, partly syncopated,
which, though in minor, does not lessen at all the high
spirits of the movement.</p>
<p>Just as the composer considered the B-flat Concerto &ldquo;not
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
one of his best works,&rdquo; so he also questioned the value of the
subsequent C major Concerto, written in 1797 and not published
(like the First Symphony) until 1801. Yet this concerto
is a great advance over its predecessor; it contains a beautifully
expressive Largo and a deliciously brisk and zestful
&ldquo;Allegro scherzando&rdquo; Rondo, marked by jocose <i>sforzandi</i> on
weak beats and various striking rhythmic displacements.
Taken as a whole, there is far more of what we recognize as a
true Beethoven quality in this misnamed First Concerto than
there is in the so-called Second.</p>
<p>The Third Piano Concerto (C minor, opus 37), composed
in 1800 but not played publicly till about three years later,
is a great advance on its two predecessors from every standpoint.
The proximity of the more &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; Beethoven is immediately
evident. Indeed, it probably possessed more of
the unmistakably heroic quality than any other concerto written
before its time. The solo part is different and more striking
in originality than anything in the concertos in B-flat and
C major; and a symphonic breadth pervades the work, notably
the opening movement. The second movement&mdash;a
Largo in E&mdash;begins in the piano and is then sung by muted
strings. There is a passage that, strangely enough, sounds
like a prophecy of the melody of the tenor air <i>Salut demeure</i>
in Gounod&rsquo;s opera <i>Faust</i> and may easily have suggested it to
the French composer. Before the close of the Largo there is a
cadenza &ldquo;con gran espressione.&rdquo; The Rondo brings back the
key of C minor and is, in a variety of ways, a most remarkable
movement. Curiously enough, the coda appears to have
been inspired by the closing page of Mozart&rsquo;s C minor Concerto
which, some time earlier, had so struck Beethoven that
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
he remarked to another musician: &ldquo;None of us will ever write
anything like that!&rdquo; And the composer was not to occupy
himself further with piano concertos for several years till in
1806 he created his most deeply poetic (the Fourth, in G
major, opus 56), and again till 1809, when he wrote his most
spacious and lavish, the E-flat (&ldquo;Emperor&rdquo;), by which time
he had behind him several of his monumental productions.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony No. 2, in D Major, Opus 36</h3>
<p>Beethoven composed the Second Symphony in very different
circumstances from the first. The deafness that had first
manifested itself several years previously and was in time to
become complete had reached such a point that on the advice
of his doctor he decided to spend the summer of 1802 in the
village of Heiligenstadt, which, though near Vienna, was then
deep in the country. It was a tragic summer for Beethoven,
as he himself has testified in that infinitely pathetic document
known as the &ldquo;Heiligenstadt Will.&rdquo; He would probably have
taken his own life but for his determination to consecrate himself
with new courage to his art. His life was further complicated
by a love affair with the youthful Countess Giulietta
Guicciardi. Whether or not this love affair was as serious as
some have maintained, the Countess preferred Count Gallenberg
to the turbulent composer and accordingly married him.</p>
<p>In such a setting Beethoven undertook his Second Symphony.
This work, however, reflects his tragedy only here and
there and in a richer romanticism than his music had previously
expressed&mdash;a romanticism of the nineteenth century. As
in the case of the First Symphony, the Second, in D major,
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
has a slow introduction (&ldquo;Adagio molto&rdquo;), but this introduction
is much longer and, though based in style on Haydn&rsquo;s
symphonic introductions, is instilled with the new romantic
freedom and contains a surprising prediction of the Ninth
Symphony in a descending octave passage.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Allegro con brio&rdquo; that follows starts off with a buoyant
theme which sets the pace for an energetic and generally
cheerful movement. It is in the ensuing Larghetto in A major
that we hear in full proclamation the individual voice of
Beethoven as we have not heard it before. This has been aptly
called one of the most luxurious slow movements in the world,
and its richness in melodies has been set down as &ldquo;reckless.&rdquo;
Here are two of them:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig6">
<a href="music/img007.mid"><img src="images/img007.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="231" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img007.mid">play music</a></p>

<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img007a.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The next movement, again in D major, is this time called
frankly a &ldquo;Scherzo,&rdquo; not a &ldquo;Menuetto.&rdquo; This concise Allegro is
particularly noteworthy for the prophecy in its Trio of the
Trio of the Scherzo of the Ninth Symphony.</p>
<p>The Finale, &ldquo;Allegro molto&rdquo; in D, is a forthright, humorous
rondo. In view of the tragedy of that summer, this symphony,
at once romantic and exuberant, might perhaps best be
looked upon as an escape. Brought out on April 5, 1803, at a
concert of Beethoven&rsquo;s works given by the composer at the
Theater an der Wien, Vienna, it was coolly received, being
regarded by many listeners as extravagant or enigmatic.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony No. 3, in E-flat Major (&ldquo;<span class="mixcase">Eroica</span>&rdquo;), Opus 55</h3>
<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s next symphony, though begun in the summer
of 1803, was not completed till the following year. As long
before as 1802 Beethoven had declared his dissatisfaction
with his works up to that time: &ldquo;From today I mean to take a
new road.&rdquo; This symphony boldly takes that road. The Second
Symphony still belongs largely to the eighteenth century.
The Third embodies the developments with which Beethoven
revolutionized the symphony. In amplitude and opulence no
previous symphonic movement had ever equalled or even
approached the initial &ldquo;Allegro con brio,&rdquo; and it may be
doubted whether any has subsequently surpassed it. Sensitive
listeners hearing it for the first time may well have cried
out with Miranda: &ldquo;O brave new world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There ensues a Funeral March that is one of the most tremendous
lamentations conceived in any art. The Scherzo is
not only the first but one of Beethoven&rsquo;s symphonic scherzos,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
it is also among the greatest. For the Finale Beethoven provides
a theme and variations of astonishing diversity and
splendor.</p>
<p>The first and dominating theme of the &ldquo;Allegro con brio&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig8">
<a href="music/img008.mid"><img src="images/img008.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="86" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img008.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>Beethoven very likely remembered from Mozart&rsquo;s little <i>Bastien
und Bastienne</i> overture, but he uses it here in the grand
manner. The Funeral March begins with a striking phrase in
C minor. A tender lyric passage in C major introduces an
elegiac element into the sternness of the dirge. The Scherzo
(&ldquo;Allegro vivace&rdquo; in E-flat major) is an enormously energetic
movement and is interrupted by a Trio, prophetic in its turn
of the Ninth Symphony and including a particularly brilliant
and difficult passage for the horns.</p>
<p>The theme of the concluding variations (&ldquo;Allegro molto&rdquo;
in E flat major) Beethoven had previously employed in his
ballet, <i>The Creatures of Prometheus</i>. This theme, simple as it
appears, contains the germ of one of the most remarkable sets
of variations ever put down on paper.</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig9">
<a href="music/img009.mid"><img src="images/img009.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="182" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img009.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The Third Symphony is universally known today less by
its number and its key than by the title &ldquo;Eroica&rdquo; (&ldquo;Heroic&rdquo;).
Everybody is familiar with the story of the relation of this
symphony to Napoleon Bonaparte. Beethoven, sympathetic
toward the republican ideals of the French Revolution, originally
hailed General Bonaparte as the Great Liberator, but
when in May 1804 he accepted the imperial crown of France,
Beethoven saw him in an entirely different light. Such was
his rage that he was on the point of destroying this symphony,
which he had intended to dedicate to Bonaparte as a tribute
to his services to mankind. Fortunately he desisted, tore
Bonaparte&rsquo;s name from the inscription, and entitled the work
&ldquo;Eroica.&rdquo; It should not be forgotten, though, that when seventeen
years later he heard of the death of Napoleon at St.
Helena, he remarked, &ldquo;I have already composed the proper
music for that catastrophe,&rdquo; which was an allusion to the
Funeral March.</p>
<p>The meaning of the symphony as a heroic work is clear
enough to anyone who hears the first movement and the
Funeral March. Perhaps only Anton Rubinstein has ever
questioned the heroic quality of the first movement and nobody
has or could doubt the heroism of the mighty threnody
that follows. But to fit the brilliant Scherzo and the dazzling
set of variations into the picture has occasioned any amount
of controversy. To go at length into the various theories is
impossible here, but one might point out that the Scherzo has
been interpreted as a scene in the hero&rsquo;s camp, as an excited
crowd waiting for the hero&rsquo;s return and his triumphant address
in the Trio, and as a picture of funeral games at the
grave of the hero, such as one finds in the epic poems of
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Homer and Virgil, this last theory being that of Berlioz. The
variations of the Finale have been plausibly explained as the
nations of the earth bringing each its tribute of flowers to
deck the hero&rsquo;s monument. The first performance of this
transcendent symphony took place in Vienna on April 7,
1805.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony No. 4, in B-flat Major, Opus 60</h3>
<p>Three years elapsed between the completion of the &ldquo;Eroica&rdquo;
Symphony and the emergence of the Fourth Symphony. The
latter was brought out in Vienna at a special subscription
concert organized for Beethoven&rsquo;s benefit in the middle of the
latter part of March 1807. Little is known about the origin
and composition of this work and its relation to the other
circumstances of Beethoven&rsquo;s life. Apparently he had been
busy with his C minor Symphony (the Fifth) when in 1805
he laid that aside to write a symphony in B flat. This act of his
is in line with his general procedure with regard to his symphonies,
a lighter work following one of deep import. Robert
Schumann, a distinguished critic as well as a great composer,
likened the Fourth Symphony as related to the &ldquo;Eroica&rdquo; and
the Fifth to &ldquo;a slender Greek maiden between two Norse
giants.&rdquo; This comparison, however, lays too much emphasis
on youthful ingenuousness, for humor and the joy of living
have their place here, and romance as well, with touches of
passion and of mystery. One of its admirers has called it a
&ldquo;symphony of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mystery and romance are evoked in the elaborate introduction
(Adagio), which this symphony like the Second possesses,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
but the mood turns to merriment when the &ldquo;Allegro
vivace&rdquo; enters with this skipping tune:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig10">
<a href="music/img010.mid"><img src="images/img010.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="192" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img010.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The second movement (Adagio in E-flat major) is related
in its luxuriance and melodic richness to the Larghetto of the
Second Symphony, establishing another bond between the
two works. A hint of the beauty of this movement may be
gathered from the first theme:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig11">
<a href="music/img011.mid"><img src="images/img011.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="87" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img011.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The fervor that breathes through its measures has been attributed
to Beethoven&rsquo;s contemporaneous engagement to the
Countess Therese von Brunswick, to whom many believe he
addressed the famous &ldquo;Immortal Beloved&rdquo; letter. Berlioz,
like Schumann eminent not only as composer but as critic,
accounts for this Adagio in a still loftier vein: &ldquo;The being who
wrote such a marvel of inspiration as this movement was not
a man. Such must be the song of the Archangel Michael as he
contemplates the world&rsquo;s uprising to the threshold of the
empyrean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the third movement Beethoven returns to the name
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
&ldquo;menuetto&rdquo; (&ldquo;Allegro vivace&rdquo; in B-flat major; Trio, &ldquo;un poco
meno Allegro,&rdquo; in B-flat major), though &ldquo;scherzo&rdquo; would do
quite as well. This minuet is planned on a particularly large
scale and is further remarkable for the fact that, as in the
Scherzo of the Seventh Symphony, the Trio is played twice
and the Minuet proper repeated each time. The attentive
listener should also heed the striking change of key to B-flat
minor at the fifth bar. The exuberant Finale (&ldquo;Allegro ma
non troppo&rdquo; in B-flat major) is perpetual motion in music,
flashing and glittering with tunefulness and fun.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Sonatas</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Beethoven&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; says Paul Bekker, &ldquo;is based on the
pianoforte; therein lie its roots and there it first bore perfect
fruit.&rdquo; Yet it is a curious paradox that he abandoned this phase
of composition relatively early, producing the majority of his
works for the keyboard before he was forty. A number of
reasons might be cited for this&mdash;his growing deafness, the
consequent impossibility of his public appearances as performing
virtuoso, the circumstance that his intellect outgrew
the expressive capacity of the piano, and the immense broadening
and deepening of his creative faculties which demanded
subtler and more ramified channels of expression.
&ldquo;The pianoforte is and always will be a disappointing instrument,&rdquo;
he said at one stage of his career. And he was distressed
that his compositions for the piano exclusively always
produced on him the most regrettable impression. &ldquo;Oh! Beethoven,
what an ass you were!&rdquo; he exclaimed on one occasion
when someone played him his own Variations in C minor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Nevertheless, the tremendous series of thirty-two sonatas,
which began, roughly speaking, in 1795 and continued more
or less intermittently till 1822, are among his most moving,
gracious, original, adventurous, and completely extraordinary
achievements. They range all the way from the so-called
&ldquo;Path&eacute;tique,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pastoral,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Moonlight&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Waldstein,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Appassionata,&rdquo; and the programmatic &ldquo;Les
Adieux, l&rsquo;Absence et le Retour,&rdquo; to the mighty series beginning
in 1816 with the A major, opus 101, and culminating in
the gigantic B flat, opus 106 (universally known as &ldquo;for the
Hammerklavier&rdquo;), the extraordinarily imaginative ones in E
major and A flat, opera 109 and 110, and the transcendent,
Promethean C minor, opus 111. Within the cosmic limits of
this stupendous succession there stretches a whole world of
emotional experience and an incalculable diversity of invention.
And we may as well mention here (though it was not
composed till 1823) that prodigious set of Thirty-three Variations
on a Waltz by the publisher Diabelli, which has not
its like in the whole range of Beethoven&rsquo;s output. Looking
back over the immense panorama of the composer&rsquo;s piano
works (including variations, bagatelles, and solo sonatas)
stretching, let us say, from the awesome summits of the
&ldquo;Hammerklavier,&rdquo; the C minor, and the &ldquo;Diabelli&rdquo; Variations
backward to the comparative simplicities of the sonatas
Opera 2, 22, 26, and 27 leaves one with the dizzy impression
of surveying a whole Alpine panorama.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony No. 5, in C Minor, Opus 67</h3>
<p>As we have seen, Beethoven interrupted work on a symphony
in C minor to write his Fourth Symphony. That done,
he returned to the C minor Symphony, finishing it late in
1807 or early in 1808. Both this Fifth Symphony and its successor,
the Sixth, were brought out in Vienna at the same concert
on December 22, 1808. The Fifth Symphony has turned
out to be the most unreservedly admired, the most generally
beloved, and the most frequently performed of all Beethoven&rsquo;s
nine, in fact, of all symphonies. It is the drama in tone
of man&rsquo;s victorious struggle with destiny and it was largely
composed at Heiligenstadt, Beethoven&rsquo;s own spiritual battlefield.
In 1801 Beethoven had made himself this promise: &ldquo;I
will take Fate by the throat; it shall not wholly overcome
me.&rdquo; The C minor Symphony opens with an intensely dramatic
figure of four notes which Beethoven explains as &ldquo;Fate
knocking at the door&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig12">
<a href="music/img012.mid"><img src="images/img012.jpg" alt="music" width="400" height="83" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img012.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>This rhythmic group not only dominates the concise first
movement, but appears in every succeeding movement. The
second movement (&ldquo;Andante con moto&rdquo; in A-flat major)
consists of a graceful, flowing set of variations on a brave and
lovely theme:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<div class="img music" id="fig13">
<a href="music/img013.mid"><img src="images/img013.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="193" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img013.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The uncanny Scherzo (Allegro in C minor), introduced
merely by the common chord of C minor in arpeggio, is the
musical embodiment of the terror that walketh by night.
Berlioz said of the opening, &ldquo;It is as fascinating as the gaze of
a mesmerizer.&rdquo; An extraordinary bridge passage, a supreme
example of musical suspense, leads from the nightmare of the
Scherzo finally in a breathtaking crescendo to the triumphant
proclamation of the C major Finale. The effect produced by
this symphony on a contemporary composer is indicated in
the frenetic outburst of the veteran composer Lesueur to the
youthful Berlioz: &ldquo;Ouf! Let me get out; I must have air. It is
unbelievable! Marvellous! It has so upset and bewildered me
that when I wanted to put on my hat, <i>I could not find my
head</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony No. 6, in F Major, &ldquo;Pastoral&rdquo;, Opus 68</h3>
<p>In the three symphonies that successively precede the
Sixth, Beethoven, as we have seen, is concerned with man as
lover or as hero, for the spiritual conflict of the Fifth Symphony
is no less heroic than are the exploits and lamentations
of the Third. The Sixth Symphony, however, though quite as
personal, treats of man from a totally different angle. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
symphony, which the composer himself called &ldquo;Pastoral,&rdquo; is
Beethoven&rsquo;s monument to Nature. It expresses his personal
devotion to the country and to what life in the country meant
to him. He spent a great deal of time in the lovely Viennese
countryside, especially at Heiligenstadt, but here the country
is no battlefield as it had been in the summer of 1802, the
summer of the &ldquo;Heiligenstadt Will&rdquo;; it is rather the cheerful,
sunlit province of Nature&rsquo;s healing power.</p>
<p>Copious and quaint is the verbal testimony to Beethoven&rsquo;s
pleasure in Nature. A lodging had once been bespoken for
him at the coppersmith&rsquo;s at Baden (near Vienna). When he
saw there were no trees around the house, he exclaimed,
&ldquo;This house won&rsquo;t do for me. I love a tree more than a man.&rdquo;
According to the Countess Therese von Brunswick, his one-time
betrothed, &ldquo;he loved to be alone with Nature, to make
her his only <i>confidante</i>. When his brain was seething with
confused ideas, Nature at all times comforted him. Often
when his friends visited him in the country in summer, he
would rush away from them.&rdquo; Charles Neate, one of the
founders of the London Philharmonic Society, who was on
intimate terms with Beethoven in Vienna in 1815, assures us
that he had &ldquo;never met anyone who so delighted in Nature, or
so thoroughly enjoyed flowers or clouds or other natural objects.
Nature was almost meat and drink to him; he seemed
positively to exist upon it.&rdquo; Michael Krenn, Beethoven&rsquo;s body-servant
during the last summer of his life when he was staying
at his brother&rsquo;s house at Gneixendorf, relates that Beethoven
spent most of his time in the open air from six in the
morning till ten at night, ranging over the fields, often hatless,
shouting (he had long been completely deaf), gesticulating,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
and in general quite beside himself from the torrent of ideas
in his mind.</p>
<p>The character of the Sixth Symphony Beethoven immediately
makes plain on the dedicatory page. &ldquo;Pastoral Symphony,&rdquo;
he calls it, &ldquo;or a recollection of country life. More an
expression of feeling than a painting.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;more&rdquo; is
important, for actually the symphony is in part a painting in
tone, even if not for the greater part. Instead of keeping to
the traditional four movements, this symphony rejoices in
five, each carrying an identifying title. The first, &ldquo;Allegro ma
non troppo&rdquo; in F major, explains itself thus: &ldquo;The cheerful
impressions excited on arriving in the country.&rdquo; It begins immediately
with this theme:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig14">
<a href="music/img014.mid"><img src="images/img014.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="208" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img014.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>which really holds the germ of the entire movement and, as
Beethoven develops it, becomes as the whole countryside in
Maytime bloom.</p>
<p>The second movement, &ldquo;Andante molto moto&rdquo; in B-flat
major, is more definite in its treatment of Nature. Beethoven
calls it &ldquo;Scene by the brookside,&rdquo; and from the very first note

<p>Against this murmurous background lovely melodies bud
and flower and the whole orchestra seems filled with the tiny,
numberless noises of summer. Near the end occurs a specific
imitation of the call of birds, nightingale, cuckoo, and quail.
Beethoven himself said that he meant these measures as a
joke, and others have termed them parody or caricature. But,
joke or parody, the unconquerable artist in Beethoven has
made them of one substance with the heavenly summer light
and shade that pervade this interlude of leisure by the brook.</p>
<p>Though not entitled Scherzo, the third movement, Allegro
in F major, is one in fact. Here the human beings that people
this countryside possess the picture. Beethoven labels the
movement &ldquo;Jolly gathering of country folk.&rdquo; Its downright
gayety brings in its train an amusing takeoff on a village band,
especially the befuddled bassoon. The middle part of the
movement, &ldquo;In tempo d&rsquo;allegro,&rdquo; corresponding to the usual
trio, has been construed by some as a quarrel among the dancers,
by others as just a rude episode in the dance. The jolly
character of the movement is evident in these consecutive
tunes, in the contrasting keys of F and D, that start it off:</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The last three movements of the symphony are continuous.
A dominant seventh of F ends the &ldquo;Jolly Gathering,&rdquo; but,
instead of its resolving, an ominous drum roll on D flat immediately
ushers in the fourth movement, &ldquo;Thunderstorm;
Tempest&rdquo; (Allegro in D minor), the storm without which no
country scene is perfect. In spite of the formidable title, this
is by no means a devastating outburst, though quite sufficient
to postpone festivities. Memorable is the feeling of tension
in the opening measures, the distant grumbling of the thunder,
the first staccato raindrops. The disappearing tempest is
followed directly by the last movement: &ldquo;Shepherd&rsquo;s Song;
joyous and thankful feelings after the storm.&rdquo; Happiness settles
on the landscape once more, as this light-hearted tune
abundantly proves:</p>

</div>
<p>Some of the melodies in this symphony are said to be derived
from Carinthian or Styrian folk songs. As we have observed,
the work was originally brought out at the same concert
in Vienna (December 22, 1808) with the Fifth Symphony.
Since it had an earlier place on the program, it was
known for a while as the Fifth and the Fifth as the Sixth, but
the mistake was soon rectified.</p>

<h3 class="generic"><i>Fidelio</i> and the &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; Overtures</h3>
<p>The period of Beethoven&rsquo;s Second, Third, and Fourth
Symphonies covers, roughly speaking, a number of other
compositions, some of them relatively trifling, others of
greater moment, still others of altogether sovereign importance.
Among the first type we can mention the Romances in
G and F for violin and orchestra, composed in 1802; the
oratorio &ldquo;Christ on the Mount of Olives,&rdquo; from the same year;
and the Triple Concerto for piano, violin, and cello, which
dates from 1805. The two Romances are fluent, lyrical movements,
but without special depth or originality. The &ldquo;Mount
of Olives,&rdquo; a sort of dramatic cantata which at first enjoyed
an almost incredible popularity, for which it has paid with
speedy and wholesale neglect, is a score of extremely uneven
value, which handles a religious subject in a superficial, operatic
fashion scarcely in keeping. Here and there it is possible
to find in it interesting details but the chances for a revival
of this work (which Beethoven&rsquo;s intelligent contemporary,
Rochlitz, criticized in spots as &ldquo;comic&rdquo;) are remote.
The Triple Concerto, though not a masterwork of the first
order, has been somewhat too harshly dismissed by many and
therefore seldom visits our concert halls.</p>
<p>Otherwise the principal productions of these years include
a quantity of the brightest jewels in Beethoven&rsquo;s crown. Leaving
aside the chamber music, which we prefer to consider by
itself, they comprise the opera <i>Fidelio</i> and the three &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo;
Overtures written in connection with it; the Violin Concerto
(which the composer also arranged as a sort of piano concerto);
and the &ldquo;Coriolanus&rdquo; Overture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p><i>Fidelio</i>, which Beethoven originally called <i>Leonore</i>, was
begun in 1804. A child of sorrow to its composer, it was not
to achieve the form in which we now know it till 1814. In
the odd century and a half of its existence it has been attacked
for countless reasons in spite of which it lives on with an incredible
tenacity and obstinately refuses to die. It has been
reproached for being poor theater, undramatic, unvocal,
patchy, and countless other things. The book, originally
adapted from <i>Leonore, ou l&rsquo;amour conjugale</i>, by the Frenchman,
Bouilly, and translated into German by Joseph Sonnleithner,
was cast into its definitive form by Friedrich
Treitschke. For a variety of reasons the work failed when it
was first performed at the Theater an der Wien in November
1805. A bold attempt at revision the following season did not
manage to keep it afloat and it was not till eight years later
that the composer, with the clever dramatic surgery of
Treitschke, made a final attempt to salvage it. Just how
drastic were the alterations that the composer and librettist
made in the piece can best be appreciated by those who have
had the opportunity to examine the reconstruction of the
original version which Erich Prieger published in 1905 on the
occasion of the centenary of the work. From this it can be
seen that not only have entirely new musical numbers supplanted
the old but the opera (or rather <i>Singspiel</i>) has been
reduced from its original three acts to two and that the
dramaturgy betrays a vastly more experienced hand. The
musical changes and condensations of Beethoven have, in
their way, been no less thorough.</p>
<p>Far from being bad theater or unoperatic as sometimes
charged, <i>Fidelio</i> is basically one of the most dramatic and
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
profoundly moving masterpieces the lyric theater can show.
The 1805 version lacked a number of its most striking musical
features. The original, for example, shows no trace of the
great outburst, <i>Abscheulicher</i>, which introduces Leonore&rsquo;s
tremendous <i>scena</i> in the first act; and in the second, Florestan&rsquo;s
dungeon air lacks its present &ldquo;Und sp&uuml;r ich nicht holde,
sanft s&auml;uselnde Duft,&rdquo; which took the place of the long-winded
bravura phrases the composer originally gave the presumably
starving prisoner to sing. Even the present touching
close of the dungeon episode was originally quite different.</p>
<p>It has often been claimed that the previous &ldquo;failure&rdquo; of
the work so discouraged the composer that his operatic
achievements ended then and there. As a matter of fact,
Beethoven to the end of his days never gave up his search
for another libretto. That he never found it was due to the
very special slant of his requirements. As for the &ldquo;unvocal&rdquo;
character of his writing for voices, it is necessary to remember
that, for all the opera&rsquo;s undeniable exactions, generations of
great dramatic singers have repeatedly triumphed in the
chief roles of <i>Fidelio</i>.</p>
<p>Beethoven composed four overtures to his opera&mdash;the three
so-called &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; Overtures in C and the one in E major,
known as the &ldquo;Fidelio&rdquo; Overture. The last-named was written
in 1814 for Treitschke&rsquo;s new version of the piece. It is the
slightest of them all and is the one that invariably prefaces
performances of the opera. For years controversies have
raged as to the order in which the &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; Overtures were
written and for what reason one supplanted the other. The
Second Leonore was the first used to preface the drama at
its 1805 hearing; the Third introduced the 1806 revision.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Theories have been bandied about for generations to account
for the First Overture, which was issued as Opus 138 only
some years after the composer&rsquo;s death. The researches of Dr.
Joseph Braunstein in his exhaustive study <i>Beethovens
Leonore-Ouvert&uuml;ren, eine historischstilkritische Untersuchung</i>
have settled the problem for us. The overtures were
composed in the order of their numbering. &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; No. 1
was found too light for its purpose and, after a private try-out,
was discarded before being publicly performed. &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo;
No. 2, less polished and formally perfect than the more
structural and popular No. 3, ranks if anything as more dramatic,
modern, and powerful, even if it does lack the brilliantly
jubilant coda that is the particular glory of No. 3.
Neither of these two, however, is a wholly well-conceived
introduction to <i>Fidelio</i>, for the reason that both overpower
the opera as a whole and might almost be said to render the
drama superfluous. Actually, a <i>Fidelio</i> representation profits
by the omission of all the &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; Overtures, though practically
every audience these days expects the &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; No.
3 quite as a matter of course and ordinarily gets it as a sort of
interlude between the dungeon and the concluding scenes.</p>
<p>A word as to the &ldquo;Fidelio&rdquo; Overture of 1814, which has
none of the features of the &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; tone poems, either
thematically or otherwise. It is more in the character of a
<i>Singspiel</i> overture and has as good as no dramatic connection
with the opera itself&mdash;no reference to Florestan&rsquo;s dungeon
song nor to the off-stage fanfare of the rescue scene; yet it
leads quite properly into the light moods of the opening episodes
of the chattering Marzelline and Jacquino in the first
scene and does not, like the Second and Third &ldquo;Leonore,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
completely overweight the remainder of the score. At that,
it is structurally and otherwise fully worthy of its composer
and is a more logical adjunct to <i>Fidelio</i> than any one of the
&ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; Overtures. Actually, it is a good deal more interesting
in its own right than the average person imagines and
merits far closer study than it ordinarily receives.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Coriolanus&rdquo; Overture virtually coincides, in point of
time, with the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Symphonies. One of
its creator&rsquo;s most striking, yet economically fashioned works,
it is in no way related to Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Coriolanus</i> as has frequently
been imagined, but was derived from a Coriolanus
tragedy by Heinrich von Collin. Yet many (including Richard
Wagner) have interpreted it in terms of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
drama, the basic emotional pattern of which it can suggest.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony No. 7, in A Major, Opus 92</h3>
<p>After the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, Beethoven let several
years pass without giving the world another, though he
continued to compose diligently in spite of uncertain health
and ever-increasing deafness. At length, in 1812, he finished
two symphonies, which were probably played in private for
the first time at the house of the Archduke Rudolph in Vienna
on April 20, 1813. He was unable, however, to obtain a public
performance for either of them till the Seventh Symphony
was given in the great hall of the University of Vienna on
December 8 of the same year.</p>
<p>Beethoven himself spoke of this work as his &ldquo;most excellent&rdquo;
symphony, an opinion that not a few have echoed. He
composed it in all the exuberance of his creative maturity,
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
and each of its four movements brims over with the fiery
essence of his inspiration. The listener is overpowered by the
very lavishness of its beauty. In this symphony you feel
Beethoven&rsquo;s genius as something inexhaustible, glorying in
its own titanic power, as of a high god ignoring lesser breeds,
proud in the knowledge of invincible strength, unfettered,
carefree, save where the Allegretto acknowledges a divine
melancholy.</p>
<p>Coming after the &ldquo;Pastoral&rdquo; with its avowed meaning, does
this symphony &ldquo;mean&rdquo; anything in the sense in which that
work and the &ldquo;Eroica&rdquo; do? Beethoven has not helped us with
the clue of a title. However, there are students of the Seventh
to whom it has yielded a quite definite meaning. Two of the
most eminent are Richard Wagner and the French composer
Vincent d&rsquo;Indy. To Wagner the Seventh Symphony is the
&ldquo;apotheosis of the dance.&rdquo; To d&rsquo;Indy it is a second &ldquo;Pastoral&rdquo;
Symphony, full of bird-calls and other country sounds. Of
course Wagner&rsquo;s definition recognizes the great part played
in it by rhythm.</p>
<p>The Seventh Symphony begins in its title key of A major
with a long introduction (&ldquo;Poco sostenuto&rdquo;), which almost
has the importance of a separate movement. The second theme
of this introduction&mdash;a capricious, tripping melody, first given
out by a solo oboe&mdash;is not only one of the most captivating
that Beethoven ever invented, but might very well be taken
for an invitation to the dance or, perhaps equally well, for the
caroling of a bird:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<div class="img music" id="fig18">
<a href="music/img018.mid"><img src="images/img018.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="181" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img018.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The principal theme of the main body of the movement
(Vivace in A major), first announced by the flute,
dominates the whole movement with its dotted dactylic
rhythm. This theme, in its turn, might be a further invitation
to the dance or again the piping of a bird.</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig19">
<a href="music/img019.mid"><img src="images/img019.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="169" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img019.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The second movement, an Allegretto opening in A minor
on a long-held, mysterious 6-4 chord of the tonic, is one of
the most remarkable pages in all Beethoven. Here, if the
dance simile is to be preserved, it must be a solemn, ritual
dance. Thus the movement has been likened to a procession
in the catacombs. But it has been likened as well to the love
dream of an odalisque!</p>
<p>The third movement is a brilliant Scherzo, though marked
only &ldquo;Presto&rdquo; (in F major). Twice it is interrupted by the
fascinating strains of the somewhat less rapid Trio (&ldquo;Assai
meno presto&rdquo; in D major), enshrining a melody that is said
to be taken from a pilgrims&rsquo; hymn of Lower Austria:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>

<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img020.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The Finale is an Allegro of enormous energy and rhythmic
incisiveness, whose tumultuous measures have been specifically
compared to widely diverse dances. Some have heard
here the rough jollity of dancing peasants, a &ldquo;Bauertanz&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Dance of Peasants,&rdquo; while to others it is nothing less than the
ceremonial dance of those priests of Cybele, the Corybantes,
around the cradle of the infant Zeus.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Overtures</h3>
<p>In 1809-10&mdash;or only two or three years before the Seventh
and Eighth Symphonies&mdash;Beethoven was commissioned to
write incidental music for Goethe&rsquo;s tragedy of the Netherlands
under Spanish oppression, <i>Egmont</i>. The F minor Overture
ranks indisputably as one of his finest, if it is less spare
and less dour than the one to <i>Coriolanus</i>. It is a dramatic
tone poem, but not a theatrical compendium in the manner
of the &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; Overtures. Yet it has an exultant coda not
wholly dissimilar to the tremendous close of &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; No.
3. This coda is identical with the so-called &ldquo;Triumph&rdquo; Symphony
which concludes the play and was actually composed
before the overture proper.</p>
<p>The greater Beethoven overtures might be termed off-shoots
or by-products of the symphonies. Let us consider
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
them briefly at this stage irrespective of their precise dates of
composition. Not all the rest, to be sure, rise to the heights of
the &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; Overtures, the &ldquo;Egmont,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Coriolanus.&rdquo;
But it is only proper to allude to such symphonic prefaces as
the early overture to the <i>Creatures of Prometheus</i> ballet
(from the period of the First Symphony), the tenuous ones
for the Kotzebue plays <i>The Ruins of Athens</i> and <i>King
Stephen</i>, the &ldquo;Namensfeier&rdquo; Overture (an &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; piece,
written in 1814), and the magnificent, if slightly known and
largely undervalued, &ldquo;Consecration of the House,&rdquo; composed
as late as 1822 for the opening of the Josefst&auml;dter Theater in
Vienna. The influence of Handel is powerfully manifest in
this late creation, which is strongly contrapuntal in its texture
but at the same time strangely suggestive from a dramatic,
even a pictorial, standpoint.</p>
<p>Having paid something of a compliment to Handel in the
&ldquo;Consecration of the House&rdquo; Beethoven was on the point of
composing an overture on the letters of Bach&rsquo;s name a couple
of years later. The formula B-A-C-H represents in German
notation B flat, A, C, and B as employed contrapuntally not
only by Bach himself but by countless other masters since
Bach&rsquo;s epoch. Unfortunately, though he worked on studies
for such an overture till 1825, Beethoven was too occupied
with other schemes and never lived to complete it.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony No. 8, in F Major, Opus 93</h3>
<p>Although played privately in Vienna at the Archduke
Rudolph&rsquo;s on April 20, 1813, the Eighth Symphony had no
public performance till it was brought out at the Redoutensaal
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
(Vienna) on February 27, 1814. The Seventh Symphony
was on the same program and its Allegretto was encored, as
it had been at its world premi&egrave;re of the previous December.
But the new work was received with less favor. A reviewer
generously remarked that it was a mistake to place it after
the manifold beauties of the Seventh. He had no doubt that
it would be well received in future if given alone. Nevertheless
this symphony was long neglected, in spite of attempts
to make it succeed with the public by interpolating the popular
Allegretto of the Seventh!</p>
<p>Beethoven himself called the Eighth his &ldquo;little symphony
in F&rdquo; in contrast to the &ldquo;great&rdquo; symphony in A (Seventh).
Yet the indifference of the audience at the Redoutensaal
annoyed him and he testily remarked that the Eighth was
&ldquo;much better&rdquo; than the Seventh, perhaps saying more than
he really meant. There have been attempts to interpret this
symphony, to provide it with a specific program. One such
would make of it a &ldquo;military trilogy&rdquo; and d&rsquo;Indy, still under
the spell of the &ldquo;Pastoral,&rdquo; detects in it the impression made
by Nature on Beethoven&rsquo;s soul. He also hears a peasant band
burlesqued in the Trio of the Menuetto, and the Hungarian
theme employed in the Finale suggests to him the presence
of gypsy musicians amid the festivities.</p>
<p>Be all that as it may, this is the symphony of laughter&mdash;not
the laughter of childlike glee or of a reckless or despairing
levity. Rather it is the &ldquo;vast and inextinguishable laughter&rdquo;
that Shelley speaks of in <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>. It is the laughter
of a man who has lived and suffered and, scaling the
heights, has achieved the summit. So he has fashioned his
own humor and dares survey the very stars in their appointed
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
courses as integrals of a cosmic comedy. Only here and there
does a note of rebellion momentarily obtrude itself, and here
and there, in brief lyrical repose, we have, remembering Sir
Thomas Browne, an intimation of Divinity more than the ear
discovers.</p>
<p>The first movement (&ldquo;Allegro vivace e con brio&rdquo; in F major)
begins at once with a sprightly tune which tells right
away the nature of the work. The second subject of the rollicking
movement is one of Beethoven&rsquo;s most delicious inspirations:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig21">
<a href="music/img021.mid"><img src="images/img021.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="171" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img021.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The second movement (&ldquo;Allegretto scherzando&rdquo; in B-flat
major) is unique in symphonic literature. The persistent staccato
ticking that runs through it has lent credibility to the
story that the movement is based on a canon or round, &ldquo;Ta,
ta, ta, lieber Maelzel,&rdquo; sung as a tribute to Maelzel&mdash;the inventor
of that invaluable mechanical timebeater, the metronome&mdash;at
a dinner given for Beethoven before he left Vienna
for the country in July 1812. Thayer, who investigated the
story carefully, says: &ldquo;That Maelzel&rsquo;s &lsquo;ta, ta, ta&rsquo; suggested the
Allegretto to Beethoven, and that at a parting meal the canon
on this theme was sung, are doubtless true; but it is by no
means sure that the canon preceded the symphony.&rdquo; There
is a story that Beethoven himself set the date of the dinner
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
late in December 1817. In any event, the irrepressible sixteenth
notes tick away metronomically, and here is the airy
theme that leads them on:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig22">
<a href="music/img022.mid"><img src="images/img022.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="90" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img022.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>Berlioz says of this movement: &ldquo;It is one of those productions
for which neither model nor pendant can be found. This
sort of thing falls entire from heaven into the composer&rsquo;s
brain. He writes it at a single sitting, and we are amazed at
hearing it.&rdquo; This would be all very well but for the fact that
Beethoven&rsquo;s sketches show how mightily he labored over the
wholly spontaneous-seeming movement. When that eminent
pessimist, the philosopher Schopenhauer, heard it, he declared
it could make one forget that the world is filled with
nothing but misery!</p>
<p>Instead of a scherzo Beethoven proceeds with a stately
Minuet (&ldquo;Tempo di Menuetto&rdquo; in F major), which is not the
symphonic minuet of the First and the Fourth symphonies,
but a minuet in the noble manner of the eighteenth-century
dance and perhaps not untinged with irony. Here is its courtly
opening melody:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig23">

<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img023.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>In the Finale (&ldquo;Allegro vivace&rdquo; in F major) the joy is truly
unconfined and the music roars and billows with the impact
of Olympian laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h3 class="generic">Mass in C Major and the Missa Solemnis</h3>
<p>Aside from the above-mentioned oratorio <i>Christ on the
Mount of Olives</i>, Beethoven&rsquo;s major religious compositions
consist of the Mass in C major, written in 1807, and the
stupendous one in D&mdash;the overpowering <i>Missa Solemnis</i>&mdash;begun
in 1817 but not completed till 1825. The C major Mass
must not be thought of as an early creation or a thing in the
manner of the <i>Mount of Olives</i>. Actually, it is a work of the
composer&rsquo;s maturity, virtually contemporaneous with the
great &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; Overture and the Fifth Symphony. It was
written at the instance of one of the Esterhazy princes who,
when he heard the mass, infuriated Beethoven by asking:
&ldquo;Well, my dear Beethoven, what is it you have gone and
done now?&rdquo; Strangely enough, the C major Mass for all its
unquestionable beauties is treated in rather stepchildly
fashion. No greater mistake could be made than to compare
it with the <i>Missa Solemnis</i> of a much later date and of basically
different premises. &ldquo;It expresses in the region of sacred
music the joyful and victorious mood of the overture and
the Symphony,&rdquo; says Paul Bekker. &ldquo;An atmosphere of simple
piety pervades the Mass; no inner disunion, no brooding
doubt, no unsatisfied thirst for knowledge finds expression
here. The Mass in C is a confession of the composer&rsquo;s faith
and is at the same time liturgically practicable; it expresses
a great artist&rsquo;s confident belief, at a time when he was one
in thought and feeling with the &lsquo;spiritual powers that be&rsquo; of
his period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great Mass in D is a totally different proposition. It
was the slow and gradual outgrowth of one of the periods
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
of Beethoven&rsquo;s life where soul-shaking problems crowded
ceaselessly upon him. He began to work upon it with the
idea of producing it at the enthronement of his friend and
pupil, the Archduke Rudolph, as Archbishop of Olm&uuml;tz.
But as it slowly expanded the composer forgot more and
more why he had originally conceived it. It became in the
grandest and deepest sense an expression of its creator&rsquo;s profoundest
philosophies. Barring three movements of the work,
none of the <i>Missa Solemnis</i> was ever performed during the
composer&rsquo;s lifetime. And, singularly enough, those three
movements were presented at the concert on May 7, 1824,
at which the Ninth Symphony was heard for the first time.
They had one other performance before Beethoven died&mdash;in
St. Petersburg at the instigation of the Prince Galitzin.</p>
<p>The Mass in D, stupendous creation that it is, is far from
a practical church work. It lacks all pretense of ritualistic use.
For one thing, its vast proportions, the length of the individual
sections, and the duration of the score as a whole
would completely unfit it for ecclesiastical ceremony. The
Mass is &ldquo;unchurchly&rdquo; in the highest degree. According to
Bekker, Beethoven &ldquo;breaks through the walls which divide
the church from the world; his church extends to the limits
of his vision; his altar is the heart of the universe, and he
will suffer no dogmatic limitations.&rdquo; Above the Kyrie the
composer inscribed the words: &ldquo;From the heart&mdash;may it go
to the heart.&rdquo; He intended the work &ldquo;for the democratic
concert hall rather than for polite social circles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peak of the <i>Missa Solemnis</i> is undoubtedly the great
fugue &ldquo;Et vitam venturi&rdquo; of the Credo. And here, incidentally,
the demands on the singing voices are perhaps more
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
cruel than anywhere in the last movement of the Ninth
Symphony or in the most arduous pages of <i>Fidelio</i>. Only
now and then is there a wholly satisfying performance of
the Mass in D. Be this as it may, there are two pages so extraordinary
that no listener can ever fail to be stirred to the
depths by them. One is the &ldquo;Benedictus,&rdquo; with its transfigured
violin solo and a prefatory orchestral movement so
spiritualized that it takes rank by the side of the loftiest slow
movements the composer ever wrote; the other is the &ldquo;Agnus
Dei&rdquo; and its &ldquo;Prayer for inner and outer peace,&rdquo; in which
Beethoven causes the drums and trumpet calls of war to alternate
with agonized supplications for peace.</p>
<p>All the same, despite the sublimities of the work and the
vaunted &ldquo;morality&rdquo; of the composer, Beethoven did not hesitate
to offer the score to at least three different publishing
houses at practically the same time! Small wonder that, before
long, a London concert agent was writing: &ldquo;For heavens&rsquo;
sake, don&rsquo;t have any dealings with Beethoven!&rdquo; If the master
was not above attempting a little business skulduggery now
and then he did not go about it cleverly!</p>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony No. 9, in D Minor, with Final Chorus on Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode to Joy,&rdquo; Opus 125</h3>
<p>More than ten years passed after the initial performance
of the Eighth Symphony before Beethoven brought out its
successor, his ninth and last, on May 7, 1824. The earlier part
of this period was comparatively unproductive. Beethoven
was profoundly disturbed by quarrels over his guardianship
of his nephew Karl, which eventually were taken to court. His
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
health and spirits suffered and, meantime, his deafness became
complete. Nevertheless his creative impulse found expression
in two works of the grandest dimensions, the Mass
in D and the Ninth Symphony. Sketches for the symphony
were made as early as 1815&mdash;perhaps even earlier&mdash;and he
went to work on it in earnest in 1817.</p>
<p>The premi&egrave;re took place at the Kaerthnerthor Theater,
Vienna, on May 7, 1824. The problems of performance were
complicated by the composer&rsquo;s using in the final movement
a chorus and a quartet of soloists. Michael Umlauf conducted
and the solo singers were Henriette Sontag (one of the most
famous sopranos of her day), Karolina Unger, Anton Haitzinger,
and J. Seipelt. The difficulty of Beethoven&rsquo;s voice parts
gave trouble at rehearsals. Mmes. Sontag and Unger begged
him to alter their music, but in vain. Mme. Unger declared in
his presence that he was a &ldquo;tyrant over all the vocal organs.&rdquo;
Still, at the first performance it was she who led the composer
from where he had been sitting in the midst of the orchestra
to the edge of the stage to see the excited waving of the audience
and to bow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>

<p class="caption">Beethoven in Vienna, 1820-25.
<br /><i>Pen and ink sketch by J. P. Lyser.</i></p>
</div>
<p>These solo parts have lost none of their difficulty for singers,
and from the sopranos of the chorus Beethoven well-nigh
demands the superhuman. With a view to helping matters
some conductors have transposed the Finale down a whole
tone, thus dimming its brilliance and upsetting Beethoven&rsquo;s
scheme of keys. Wagner believed that Beethoven by having
words and singers in the Finale had closed the cycle of purely
orchestral music. Others, however, regard the singers as a
mistake and maintain that Beethoven recognized his error.
So devout and searching a student of Beethoven as Professor
Tovey, while dismissing as absurd the theory of Beethoven&rsquo;s
discontent with instrumental music, holds that every
part of the Ninth Symphony becomes clearer when we assume
that the choral Finale is right, and that hardly a point in the
work but becomes difficult and obscure when we assume that
the choral Finale is wrong. Though he admits that Beethoven,
long after the production of the symphony, told some friends
that the choral inclusion was a mistake and that perhaps some
day he might write an instrumental Finale, he sets this down
to a fit of depression. At any rate, the Finale stands as written
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
and there is no choice but to grapple with its problems.</p>
<p>For three movements the symphony is of course, purely
instrumental. Of the first movement (&ldquo;Allegro, ma non
troppo, un poco maestoso,&rdquo; in D minor) Ricciotto Canudo
has written: &ldquo;In the beginning was space; and all possibilities
were in space; and life was space.&rdquo; It begins pianissimo
in empty fifths. A descending figure of two notes, from the
heights to the depths, is reiterated while a tremendous crescendo
leads to the theme that dominates the movement,
given out fortissimo in unison and octaves:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig25">
<a href="music/img025.mid"><img src="images/img025.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="213" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img025.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The entire movement, which is well stocked with other
themes, has the majesty and impetus of a titanic tragedy,
and its propulsive drama ends with a defiant proclamation
of the chief theme.</p>
<p>Now Beethoven reverses his usual procedure by postponing
the slow movement and introducing a &ldquo;Molto vivace&rdquo;
(in F minor), which has been called at once the greatest
and the longest of his scherzos. A phrase of three notes,
repeated on each interval of the chord of D minor, begins
it, followed immediately by this fugal subject:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig26">
<a href="music/img026.mid"><img src="images/img026.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="82" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img026.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The enormous vitality and rhythmic drive of the Scherzo
have deafened some hearers to the bitter strain in the jest.
Joy unalloyed has not yet burst upon the scene.</p>
<p>And meanwhile Beethoven gives us the slow movement,
a combination of an &ldquo;Adagio molto e cantabile&rdquo; (in B-flat
major) and an &ldquo;Andante moderato&rdquo; (in D major), which as
a whole has been described conveniently and with reasonable
accuracy as a set of variations on two alternating themes:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig27">
<a href="music/img027.mid"><img src="images/img027.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="406" /></a>

<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img028.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>Language has been ransacked for words to express the
beauty and elevation of this Adagio-Andante. Its seraphic
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
song is dying away when the initial D minor of the Finale,
presto and fortissimo, roughly smites our ears.</p>
<p>A series of orchestral sections, in contrast and conflict,
occupy the battleground of the earlier pages before the baritone
soloist, first using words by Beethoven himself, introduces
the human voices and Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode to Joy.&rdquo; Two
of the themes brought in here the listener should keep
carefully in mind: the first is employed later by the baritone
in demanding sounds of gladness, and the second is the so-called
theme of joy:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig29">
<a href="music/img029.mid"><img src="images/img029.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="211" /></a>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Now chorus and soloists join valiantly in the good fight
for &ldquo;mirth and rapture blended&rdquo; till the symphony ends in
the victorious D major paeans, vocal and at the very last
instrumental, of universal rejoicing. The burden of Schiller&rsquo;s
praise of Joy is held in these two lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All mankind are brothers plighted</p>
<p class="t0">Where thy gentle wings abide.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And universal brotherhood is thus voiced by the tenors and
the basses in unison.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Chamber Music</h3>
<p>If Beethoven&rsquo;s best-known and most widely performed
works are the nine symphonies, his chamber music represents
the most far-reaching, diversified, profound, original, spiritualized,
and at the same time the most problematic manifestations
of his genius. It is through his quartets, when all&rsquo;s
said, that his influence has been most felt. In these dwell
the germs of more or less everything out of which subsequent
music has, in one way or another, developed. If Beethoven
may be called a &ldquo;musician of the future&rdquo; it is by reason of
his sixteen string quartets more than by anything else. More
than all else he composed they continue, in great measure,
to be in advance not only of the master&rsquo;s own time but even
of our own.</p>
<p>It may be said that his chamber music spanned his life.
The earliest specimens of it date from his Bonn days, from
around his fifteenth year. From then on they continued
(intermittently, it is true) almost up to the time of his death&mdash;indeed,
the last composition he completed was a new finale
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
for the B-flat Quartet, opus 130, to replace the original one,
the Great Fugue, now opus 133, which early audiences could
not grasp and which, to this very day, is a stumbling block for
most hearers although one of the most extraordinary and
transcendent pages Beethoven ever produced. And though
at his demise he left a quantity of sketches (including studies
for a tenth symphony) there is every reason to assume that
an even more copious quantity of chamber music might have
come from his pen had he lived five or ten years longer.</p>
<p>The mass of such chamber music as he did bequeath us
includes sonatas for piano and violin as well as for piano and
cello; a Quintet in C major, opus 29, for two violins, two
violas, and cello, dating from 1801; a quintet fugue in D,
written in 1817 but published as opus 137; a number of trios
for a variety of instrumental combinations, several duets and
serenades, and other miscellany for more or less intimate
performance. Lastly, the famous Septet in E flat, for clarinet,
horn, bassoon, violin, viola, cello, and double-bass, opus 20.
This septet was composed about 1800 and was at one time
so immeasurably popular that Beethoven himself wearied of
it. Despite the vogue it long enjoyed, it is far from one of
its creator&rsquo;s most inspired flights.</p>
<p>The series of trios for piano and strings constitute something
of a counterpart to the great string quartets. Opus 1
consists of three such trios, and the composer&rsquo;s friend Ries
wrote that &ldquo;when the three were first heard by the musical
world at one of Prince Lichnowsky&rsquo;s soir&eacute;es nearly all the foremost
artists and amateurs of Vienna were invited, among
them Haydn, whose opinion was awaited with intense interest.&rdquo;
The trios caused a sensation. Haydn, who was enthusiastic
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
about them on the whole, had reservations to make
about the third, in C minor, and advised the composer not
to publish it. Beethoven took this advice in bad part, the
more so because he regarded this trio as the best, and imagined
that his famous contemporary was actuated by envy.
The truth of the matter was that Haydn, struck by the bold
originality of the score, was honestly afraid that the public
might not understand it. But it is precisely this quality that
has lifted the C minor Trio far above the other two of opus 1.</p>
<p>The other trios for piano and strings are the pair in D
major and E-flat, opus 70, and the supremely great one in B
flat, opus 97, called the &ldquo;Archduke&rdquo; Trio because it was
dedicated to the composer&rsquo;s friend and pupil, the Archduke
Rudolph. The Opus 70 creations are remarkable for the
somewhat restless, indeed forbidding, quality that fills some
of their pages. The first has been named the &ldquo;Ghost&rdquo; Trio
on account of an eerie figure that pervades the slow movement
and lends it a strangely weird and hollow sound. The
&ldquo;Archduke&rdquo; Trio has a spaciousness and elevation, particularly
in its Largo, which is a series of five variations on a
theme in the character of a hymn. Wisely enough, Beethoven
placed the Scherzo before the profound slow movement, as
he was again to do in the &ldquo;Hammerklavier&rdquo; Sonata and the
Ninth Symphony. But this scherzo utilizes in its middle part
a curious, winding chromatic figure which ranks with the
master&rsquo;s most striking ideas at this stage of his progress.</p>
<p>Between 1799 and 1802 Beethoven wrote eight of his ten
sonatas for violin and piano. The most famous of these eight
are the fifth&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;Spring&rdquo; Sonata in F, opus 24,
which opens with a theme of lovely grace and has an adorable
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
serenity throughout its four movements&mdash;and the set in
A major, C minor, and G major, opus 30, which was published
with a dedication to Czar Alexander I of Russia. The C
minor Sonata reveals a heroic quality which lends it something
of the spirit of the &ldquo;Eroica&rdquo; Symphony, and the closing
Presto of the finale has about it an element of dramatic
grandeur. However, none of these sonatas quite reaches the
level of the &ldquo;Kreutzer&rdquo; or the much later Sonata in G major,
opus 96. The A major, opus 47, derived its name from the fact
that it was dedicated to Rudolph Kreutzer. It was first played
by a mulatto violinist named Bridgetower, while the composer
performed the piano part. Despite the haste with which
the work was composed (Czerny spoke of &ldquo;four days&rdquo;), the
sonata, &ldquo;written in a very concertante style,&rdquo; has remained
probably the best-known and most widely popular of all
Beethoven&rsquo;s sonatas for violin and piano. The music has an
expansiveness and plenitude that surpass any other work
Beethoven designed for this instrumental combination. The
finale, a whirlwind Presto originally conceived for the first
sonata of the opus 30 set, influenced Schubert when he composed
the last movement of his D minor Quartet. Undoubtedly
it is the most original, not to say the most exciting, part
of the work&mdash;more so, indeed, than the Andante, with its
series of variations so arranged that each artist is given his
adroitly balanced share.</p>
<p>The G major Sonata, composed in 1812 and first performed
by the French violinist Pierre Rode and the Archduke Rudolph,
is unquestionably the most intellectual and the
subtlest of Beethoven&rsquo;s violin sonatas. In any case it has
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
some of the unmistakable traits of the master&rsquo;s later style
about it.</p>
<p>The sonatas for cello and piano, in F major and G minor,
were composed as early as 1796 and performed in Berlin
before the King of Prussia by Beethoven and the Court cellist,
Duport. But the memorable cello sonatas of Beethoven&rsquo;s are
the one in A major, opus 69, one of his most lavish and magnificent
works; and the C major and D major, opus 102. The
first named, like the &ldquo;Kreutzer&rdquo; Sonata or the &ldquo;Appassionata&rdquo;
of the piano series, is a creation that needs no defense and
no far-fetched explanations. On the other hand, the opus
102 pair, despite their indisputable profundities, are among
Beethoven&rsquo;s more unapproachable and recondite works. Indeed,
they have about them a certain hard-shelled quality
which scarcely lends them an especially intimate or endearing
effect.</p>
<h3 class="generic">String Quartets</h3>
<p>The great series of string quartets begins with the six of
opus 18, published in 1801, and concludes, officially speaking,
with the masterpiece in F major, opus 135, completed only in
1826, but not printed till something like half a year after his
death. The half-dozen works constituting the earlier opus
had been ripening in the form of sketches and experiments
of one sort or another for several years. They were finally issued
in two numbers, each consisting of three scores. It is not
possible to determine precisely the order in which they were
written, but that fact is unimportant because the lot do not
exhibit any definite line of development. It seems that one
version of the first quartet, in F, was completed in 1799.
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Beethoven gave it to his friend, the young ecclesiastical
student Carl Amenda, but asked him to show it to nobody
because &ldquo;I have altered it considerably, having just learned
to compose quartets aright.&rdquo; Bekker finds that the revision
&ldquo;tends to a freer, more soloistic treatment of the accompanying
parts, a clearer individualization of the cello part and a
greater tonal delicacy in the ensemble effects.... The main
idea of the composition, however, remained unchanged. This
is no disadvantage, for the fresh naivet&eacute; of the content and
the unassuming clarity of structure are great charms, and
more would have been lost than gained by overmeticulous
revision. As the work stands it is gratifying to the performer
and offers pleasant, not over difficult problems to the listener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The finest part of the work is undoubtedly the second
movement, an &ldquo;Adagio affetuoso ed appassionato.&rdquo; It is the
richest in texture and certainly the most poetic and emotional
of the four. When the composer played it to Amenda he is
said to have inquired what the music suggested to him. &ldquo;It
suggests a lover&rsquo;s parting,&rdquo; replied Amenda; whereupon
Beethoven replied, &ldquo;Well, the tomb scene from <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i> was in my mind.&rdquo; And Bekker insists that this Adagio
is &ldquo;a most moving song of sorrow such as only Beethoven
could accomplish when he turned to the grave D minor key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second quartet, in G major, has been christened in
some German countries the &ldquo;Compliment Quartet.&rdquo; It is
graceful and rather courtly but it reaches none of the depths
of the more moving pages of the preceding work, The Finale,
however, is an instance of that &ldquo;unbuttoned humor&rdquo; that
Beethoven was to exhibit on later occasions and of which
he gave us supreme instances in the last movement of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
Seventh Symphony, the Eighth Symphony, and moments in
the last quartets, the &ldquo;Diabelli Variations,&rdquo; and several of
the final piano sonatas. Opus 18, No. 3, in D, is likewise
marked by a quality of gaiety, though hardly of the &ldquo;unbuttoned&rdquo;
kind.</p>
<p>The fourth work of the opus 18 set, in C minor, is more
or less a work distinct from its companions. &ldquo;A mood of deep
seriousness is common to it and the C major Quintet, opus 29,&rdquo;
believes Bekker, &ldquo;but the Quartet is full of passionate excitement,&rdquo;
and he alludes to its &ldquo;mournful earnestness ... and
restless dissatisfaction, the very opposite of the cheerful sense
of concord with the world and mankind expressed in the
other five.&rdquo; The Quartet in A major has been termed Mozartean
by some, operatic by others. Certainly it is fluent and
lilting music, of which the Minuet is in some respects the
most winning portion even if the final Allegro excels it in
expressiveness.</p>
<p>The B-flat Quartet, sixth of the series, is particularly significant
for the sombre adagio beginning of its otherwise
jubilant allegretto Finale. Beethoven has headed this introduction
(which is recalled dramatically during the movement)
&ldquo;La Malinconia: Questo pezzo si deve trattare colla
pi&ugrave; gran delicatezza&rdquo; (&ldquo;Melancholy: this piece must be
played with the greatest delicacy&rdquo;). This eerie and wholly
romantic movement is a true glimpse of the Beethoven into
whose newer world we shall presently penetrate.</p>
<p>With the three monumental quartets of opus 59 we have
entered this new sphere. They belong to the year 1806, which
means that they are of the epoch of the Fourth and Fifth
Symphonies, the third &ldquo;Leonore&rdquo; Overture, and the Violin
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
Concerto and the G major Concerto for piano. Beethoven
dedicated them to the Russian Count Rasoumovsky, whose
name is thus imperishably linked with these masterpieces;
and it was perhaps as a compliment to this nobleman that
he introduced into the first and second of these works authentic
Russian themes. Indeed, the Scherzo of the E minor
Quartet utilizes that great melody around which, more than
half a century later, Moussorgsky was to build the coronation
scene in his opera <i>Boris Godounov</i>.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Rasoumovsky&rdquo; trilogy exhibits Beethoven&rsquo;s inventive
and technical faculties at the ideal symmetry they had
achieved at the flood tide of his so-called &ldquo;Second&rdquo; period.
The F major, C major, and E minor Quartets are in some
ways the most ideally &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; ones he ever wrote; and,
with all their splendor of form and substance, they are still
replete with the most astonishing originalities and departures.
Indeed, the amazing &ldquo;Allegretto, scherzando&rdquo; movement of
the F major Quartet so astounded the players who first undertook
to perform it that they imagined Beethoven&rsquo;s rhythmic
motto theme was intended as a joke at their expense and
almost refused to go through with it. The Adagio, on the
other hand, develops, with the utmost richness of sonority
and color possible to four stringed instruments, two gorgeously
songlike themes till it seems as if they had become
expanded to orchestral dimensions. The E minor Quartet,
less a display piece than its companion works, is in a totally
different and quite as unprecedented manner, while its slow
movement (&ldquo;Molto Adagio&rdquo;) sounds a deep, spiritual note
which seems to have been inspired in the composer by a
nocturnal contemplation of a starry sky in the country around
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Baden, near Vienna. As for the C major Quartet, the third
of the &ldquo;Rasoumovsky&rdquo; set, it closes in a jubilant, sweeping
fugue, which is like a paean of triumph.</p>
<p>There are two E-flat quartets in Beethoven&rsquo;s output: the
first, opus 74, is known as the &ldquo;Harp&rdquo; Quartet by reason of
the numerous passages of plucked strings in the first movement;
the second is the tremendous opus 127. The former
is the dreamier, less challenging of the two; it is rich not
only in a sort of romanticism that looks forward to the age
of Schumann, but also in unexpected effects bearing the unmistakable
stamp of the Beethoven of the &ldquo;Emperor&rdquo; Concerto
period, though in its way it is rather less venturesome
than the &ldquo;Rasoumovsky&rdquo; trilogy. But the quartet that was
written down in 1810&mdash;the F minor, opus 95&mdash;is in another
category. It is the product of a new period of emotional
ferment and a disquiet pervades the score with the irascible
pertinacity of a gadfly. There is, indeed, a new quality of
storm and stress in this <i>Quartetto Serioso</i>, as the composer
himself designated it. Here he is in no mood for trifling. &ldquo;At
the moment when Beethoven had fought out his battle, when
he could look back on all stages of the contest and taste the
fruits of victory, he became most intensely aware of what it
had cost him,&rdquo; writes Paul Bekker, adding that &ldquo;the autographed
title shows that the composer sought no happy solution
of his problem&rdquo;&mdash;in spite of which the F minor Quartet
does, surprisingly enough, end on a note of laughter.</p>
<p>Beethoven did not busy himself with the composition of
string quartets for another fourteen years. This stretch of
time is longer than any other interval in the various series
of his compositions. It must be recalled, however, that in
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
this space he wrote the last three symphonies, the last half-dozen
piano sonatas, the <i>Missa Solemnis</i>, the definitive revision
of <i>Fidelio</i> together with its new E major overture, the
<i>Ferne Geliebte</i> song cycle, the &ldquo;Consecration of the House&rdquo;
Overture, and a quantity of other works only less significant.
Spiritually, of course, he had traversed cycles of experience
and had become, in an intellectual and artistic sense, another
being.</p>
<p>It is almost inevitable, therefore, that the next great
masterpiece of chamber music, should lift the curtain on a
new creative realm. The E-flat Quartet, opus 127, has been
properly likened to a majestic portal opening on the grand
landscape of the last four quartets&mdash;the B-flat, opus 130;
C-sharp minor, opus 131; A minor, opus 132; and the relatively
short F major, opus 135, which may be described as
a short of epilogue to the series.</p>
<p>There is nothing quite like these &ldquo;last quartets&rdquo; in Beethoven&rsquo;s
myriad-faceted output. In its way the series may
be said to transcend even the Ninth Symphony, the &ldquo;Hammerklavier&rdquo;
Sonata, and the &ldquo;Diabelli&rdquo; Variations. The
novelty, the explosive qualities, the far-darting influence of
these works (which span the nineteenth century and might
even be said to help leaven the musical art of our own time)
cannot be fully evaluated, let alone described, in this book.</p>
<p>It must suffice here to point out that the E-flat Quartet
places the listener at once in a world of unimagined wonders.
The very opening measures of the first movement with their
powerful chords sound like a heraldic annunciation. The second
movement, (&ldquo;Adagio ma non troppo e molto cantabile&rdquo;)
is a series of variations of deepest earnestness. It is as if the
composer endeavored to bring to his hearers revelations
newly unfolded to his searching vision. The &ldquo;Scherzando vivace&rdquo;
that follows is wildly and even uncannily humorous&mdash;and,
incidentally, the longest of Beethoven&rsquo;s scherzos. The
Finale is a sort of triumphal march in which &ldquo;some adventurer
from the heavens seems to visit the earth ... with tidings of
gladness, to return to his home in the heavens once more.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The B-flat Quartet is, if anything, more unusual and amazing,
and it is in reality bound by a kind of mystical thematic
kinship with the A minor and the C-sharp minor Quartets
which come next. This kinship can be traced through the
Great Fugue and is carried through the following quartets
with a variety of profound philosophical modifications. The
seven relatively brief movements of the B-flat masterpiece
culminate in the hyper-emotional Cavatina (of which Beethoven
said that remembrance of the feelings that inspired
him to compose it always stirred him to tears); and to this
sentimental outburst the harsh if stupendous fugue provided
a truly beneficent purgation. The later-written closing
Allegro, if lively and effervescent, is much less truly &ldquo;in the
picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While it is risky, if not really impossible, to speak of the
&ldquo;greatest&rdquo; of the last quartets, more than one musician would
vote for the fourteenth&mdash;the tremendous one in C-sharp
minor. The composition has seven movements, extraordinarily
diversified. Beethoven tried out one of his little pleasantries
on Schott, the publisher, and declared at first the quartet was
&ldquo;pieced together out of sundry stolen odds and ends.&rdquo; A
little later he reassured the frightened, unimaginative man
of business that it was really &ldquo;brand new.&rdquo; And subsequently
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
he said impulsively that he considered the C-sharp minor
&ldquo;my best.&rdquo; The introductory &ldquo;Adagio non troppo&rdquo; was called
by Wagner &ldquo;the most sorrowful thing ever said in music.&rdquo;
All the same, the mighty creation, after passing through unbelievable
emotional transformations, closes in a triumphal
frenzy which Wagner likened to &ldquo;the dance of the whole
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The A minor Quartet, opus 132, doubtless begun somewhat
earlier than the two preceding, is scarcely less amazing.
Its heart is the &ldquo;Molto Adagio&rdquo; movement which Beethoven
called &ldquo;Song of Thanksgiving in the Lydian mode offered to
the Deity by a convalescent.&rdquo; It is filled with a mystical quality,
a religious mood explained by the circumstance that the
composer wrote the movement (one of his longest) when recovering
from an illness. But the still more amazing fact
about this quartet is that some pages of it were conceived
for other works. It is a strange phenomenon that Beethoven
on several occasions designed a quantity of pages not wholly
sure where they would best fit, though in the end his artistic
intuitions invariably led him to discover the right place.
Just as he once intended the last movement of the &ldquo;Kreutzer&rdquo;
Sonata for one of the sonatas of the opus 30 set, so he at one
time intended the &ldquo;Alla Marcia&rdquo; that begins the finale of the
A minor Quartet for the Ninth Symphony. And the last
quartets furnish other instances of the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>The sixteenth quartet, last of the series, is rather different
from the philosophical quartets that immediately preceded
it. It is, on the whole, of lighter weight, though its brief
&ldquo;Lento assai&rdquo; movement touches hands with the ineffable
Cavatina of the B-flat Quartet. It is the shortest, though one
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
of the most moving, of Beethoven&rsquo;s slow movements. The
last movement opens with a three-note motto under which
the composer wrote the words &ldquo;Must it be?&rdquo; and followed
it with another three-note theme (Allegro) inscribed with
the words &ldquo;It must be!&rdquo; Explanations have been numerous
and often far-fetched. There is reason to believe that this
formula and the musical embodiments of this interrogation
and answer must be construed in the light of the master&rsquo;s
philosophy, with its cheerful acceptance of the inevitable.
It looks almost like a purposeful reversion to the mood of
&ldquo;La malinconia&rdquo; episode in the B-flat Quartet of opus 18.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
